## <strong>Getting Started</strong>

### <strong>Usage</strong>
1. **Training the Model:**
   If you need to retrain the model, ensure the dataset is in place (`breast_cancer.xlsx`) and run the training script (`breast_cancer_project` or `projectFinal.ipynb`).

2. **Running the Deployment Script:**
   The deployment script (`deployment.py`) is used to serve the model and make predictions. You can run it using:
    ```sh
    python deployment.py
    ```

### <strong>Files Description</strong>
- **`breast_cancer_project`:** Main Python script used for training the model.
- **`breast_cancer_project_pickle.pkl`:** Serialized model file.
- **`breast_cancer_scaler`:** Preprocessing scaler used to transform input data before making predictions.
- **`breast_cancer.xlsx`:** Dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **`deployment.py`:** Script for deploying the model to make predictions.
- **`projectFinal.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook containing the final version of the project.

## <strong>Model</strong>
The model is trained on the `breast_cancer.xlsx` dataset, which contains various features related to breast cancer. The model uses these features to predict whether a case is malignant or benign.

### <strong>Preprocessing</strong>
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Scaling features
- Encoding categorical variables

### <strong>Training</strong>
The model is trained using Logistic regression. The final trained model is serialized and saved as `breast_cancer_project_pickle.pkl`.
